# Aztec Slashing Monitor

this is a tool for the slashVeto council: it allows you to see slashoors before they are executed and provides you with the precomputed payload addresses

- fill in the [env](.env.example) and save as `.env`
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`

if you run it locally with a sequencer admin api in the env you get the bonus info of 'offense types', knowing why someone is being slashed. this feature is not included in the github pages version
